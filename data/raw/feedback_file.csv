9/18/2020,naturopathiconc, Stratification of risk of recurrence in #breast #cancer with Mammoprint is also a key factor in the ESMO data. Most women in US have not had Mammoprint done. NEJM data showing risk by grade (your graphs) in early #breastcancer over 10-20 years is much more robust  and practical.
